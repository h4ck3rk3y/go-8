# go-8 
A chip-8 emulator written in Go. I am trying to learn go-lang for fun and I have always been fascinated with emulators, so I decided to write one in Go. I am using the following [manual](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#1nnn) as reference.

## Test Instructions

```bash
- git clone http://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/go-8
- cd go-8
- go get -v -t -d ./...
- go test --cover
```
